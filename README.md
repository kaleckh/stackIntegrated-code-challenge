## start details

In this project I kept the structure simple, but if this were a larger project I would organize it using feature folders with routes and a controller. something like this probably. 

src/
  people/
    peopleRoutes.js
    peopleController.js
  planets/
    planetsRoutes.js
    planetsController.js  

## How to start the server
npm i

npm start

## api endpoints
planet: localhost:3000/api/planets
person: localhost:3000/api/people
